    <h1>About EVADE</h1>

    <p>The access to EnVironmental Analytics for Developing countriEs (EVADE) project builds on STFC and NERC investments into the Community Intercomparison Suite to develop a demonstration of an easy-to-use web portal providing access to environmental analytics of "big" Earth System data to users and scientists in developing countries (maximising co-benefits for the UK scientific and commercial applications).</p>

          <p>This site is intended to demonstrate these concepts and explore the technical challenges in realising this ambition.</p>

    <h2>Funding</h2>

    <p>Funding for this initial demonstration phase was provided by STFC (ST/P003206/1). CIS is developed as open-source software and deployed for community use on the JASMIN platform provided by UK NERC, the UK Space Agency and the Science and Technology Facilities Council.</p>
